0. Provision a L4 instance on AWS and install requirements
    - Instance Details: 
    OS Image: AMI Deep Learning PyTorch 2.5 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
    Instance: g6.2xlarge
    EBS Storage Size: 120GB
    vCPU required: 8

1. Create new conda environment with Python 3.10 as the default python version
    - First use "source activate pytorch" to activate default pytorch env on the instance
    - Run "conda create -n "env_name" python=3.10" to create new environment

2.  Install Requirements for int8
    - install requirements using install_requirements.sh in custom_script folder
        -- cd into custom_script folder and run install_requirements and cd .. if not in parent folder after
    - Install recommended triton version
        -- pip install triton==2.0.0
    - Install bitsandbytes
        -- pip install bitsandbytes

3.  Download Train and Val data settings
    
    Download MSCOCO_2017 using img2dataset tool
        - Run img2dataset_mscoco.sh
        - Move data to data folder based on config in your training script

    Download ImageNet_val (2012) and prepare the dataset
        - Run imagenet_val_download_prep.sh
        - Move data to data folder based on config for imagenet-val in your training script

4.  Run the recommended bash script
    - Confirm settings (tags) in train_main_int8_sw_M.sh (SwitchBack-M works better based on trial ablations.)
